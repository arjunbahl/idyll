That would be last manhattan of night for sure.</p><p>A bit out of senses, but the cold breeze, crackling leaves, and a walk down quite street is still the most vivid view of the night, more importantly the part which brings about bliss, still. </p><p>As i strolled down mindlessly i thought solitude is something i get drawn to, maybe its just me discovering my inner self, or just me trying to escape pretentious world around to find natural beauty outside. I’m not sure if the search is inward or outward. What is it that people want ultimately? What am i looking for? Conversation for another day, let it be.</p><p>There seems to be certain order within chaos, i mean isn’t it perfect to observe palm trees swinging around and the vast ocean that lays in front of it. What a beauty to admire. The indefinite stretch of sea, so calm, in perfect flow, deterministic and yet this palm tree, so turbulent, both in the same frame. Why would anyone spend a night in that basement, would’ve loved another manhattan right here on the shore, jazz music should’ve been played here outside, beneath the stars. This is my <em>Starry Night</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night">1</a></p><p>Okay no more existential conversations, damn take it easy man. </p><span class="aside-container"><span class="aside"><div style="position:fixed" class="fixed"><img src="static/images/2BD2C79D-8AEE-4CAB-A233-A6BE776270B4.jpg"/></div></span></span></div></div></div></div>
